**HiLo Card Game

This game is a simple guessing game. The computer randomly chooses 2 cards, ranging in value from 1-13. The player starts 
out with 300 points. The first of the two cards is revealed, and the player has to guess if the second card is Higher or 
Lower in value than the first. If the player guesses correctly, they gain 100 points; however, if they guess wrong, they 
lose 75 points. The player then decides if they want to play again. 
If they chose to play again and reach 0 points, or they do not wish to play again, the game is over.
